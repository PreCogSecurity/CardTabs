                     IF   you   happen  to  have  read  another  book  about
                Christopher Robin, you may remember that he once had a swan (or
                the swan had Christopher Robin, I don't know which) and that he
                used to call this swan Pooh. That was a long time ago, and when
                we said good-bye, we took the name with us, as we didn't  think
                the  swan  would  want it any more. Well, when Edward Bear said
                that he would like an exciting name all to himself, Christopher
                Robin said at once, without stopping  to  think,  that  he  was
                Winnie-the-Pooh.  And  he was. So, as I have explained the Pooh
                part, I will now explain the rest of it.

                    <br> EDWARD BEAR, known to his friends  as  Winnie-the-Pooh,
                    or  Pooh  for  short,  was  walking through the forest one day,
                    humming proudly to himself. He had made up a  little  hum  that
                    very  morning, as he was doing his Stoutness Exercises in front
                    of the glass: Tra-la-la, tra-la-la, as he stretched up as  high
                    as  he could go, and then Tra-la-la, tra-la -- oh, help! -- la,
                    as he tried to reach his toes. After breakfast he had  said  it
                    over  and  over to himself until he had learnt it off by heart,
                    and now he was humming it right through, properly. It went like
                    this:
